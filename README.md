# BRCA1 Variant Protein Impact Analysis

This project analyzes the impact of BRCA1 gene variants on protein structure using a computational biology pipeline.

## Project Pipeline
1. Extraction of BRCA1 reference CDS
2. Generation of variant-specific CDS sequences
3. Combination of reference and variant sequences
4. Translation of CDS to protein sequences
5. Detection of amino acid changes
6. Variant-level protein risk scoring

## Technologies
- Python
- Biopython
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Output
- Annotated protein variant tables
- Protein position hotspot maps
- Variant risk scores

## Status
Ongoing (Bachelor Thesis Project)
